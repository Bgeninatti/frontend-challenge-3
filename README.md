# Landbot Frontend Challenge

## Description
A frontend developer must have a minimum functional programming knowledge to work with graphs. Landbot bot builder is a tool that allows creating conversational flows through graphs.

The purpose of this challenge is implementing several functions, part of a complete library to handle graphs efficiently.

## Details
Read carefully the [docs](./DOCS.md) and implement the functions defined in `./src/graph_utils.js`.

Execute tests with `npm test` and check if all functions passed.

### Documentation
> Document your code assuming that the next engineer looking at your code is a serial killer who knows where you live.

Use JSDoc 3 docummentation style. http://usejsdoc.org/


### Proposed solution

All the implemented logic is in `./src/graph_utils.js`. No helpers or external functions were required besides the described in that file.

Docstrings with links to the [object definition documentation](./DOCS.md) are included.

Compiled HTML documentation for `./src/graph_utils.js` can be found in  `./out/global.html`.
